## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - JS library
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

- How to use CSS grid to create a responsive page
- How to create cards with an overlay component
- How to use media queries to update mobile styling

### What gave me the most trouble

- learning about absolute vs. relative positioning
- styling the CSS grid so that the Profile card can fit properly was difficult. There were some times where the Category cards were X pixels too high due to the overlay on the category cards


### Continued development

This project made me realize that I needed more experience with creating divs and properly styling pages so that they are mobile and desktop friendly. I also need to work more on absolute vs relative positioning.
